# NASA Science Mission Directorate: Open-Source Science Guidance

NASA’s [Open-Source Science Initiative \(OSSI\)](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview) is a comprehensive program of activities to enable and support moving science towards openness, and it aims to implement [SMD's Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024](https://science.nasa.gov/files/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG%20Strategy_Final.pdf). OSSI includes a commitment to the open sharing of software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) as early as possible in the scientific process. The principles of open-source science are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. 

As part of the OSSI, [SMD’s Scientific Information Policy](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy) provides guidance on the open sharing of publications, data, and software created in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. [SPD-41a: Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SMD-information-policy-SPD-41a.pdf) updates the previously released [SPD-41](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf), which consolidated existing Federal and NASA policy on sharing scientific information.  SPD-41a was developed in light of new federal guidance on [Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf), studies from the National Academies, and input from the SMD scientific community. 

This repository provides guidelines, best practices, and examples of open-source science to support the SMD scientific community in implementing the requirements of SPD-41a and achieving the broad OSSI goal of moving science towards openness. **Please note the [Limitations](#limitations) to this guidance.** This guidance represents general recommendations and best practices for the SMD scientific community and should be considered alongside any additional guidance provided by SMD Divisions or specific funding solicitations. For additional information about SPD-41a and other scientific information policies that correspond to SMD Divisions, see the [Scientific Information Policy website](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy) and [Frequently Asked Questions \(FAQ\)](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy_faq). For additional open science resources and training opportunities, see NASA’s see [NASA’s Transform to Open Science \(TOPS\) program](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/).

## Contributing

Contributions to the repository are welcome! Following the best practices of open science, this material can be best built through the collective knowledge of the community. To report something that needs to be fixed or suggesting an addition, contributions can be made through opening an issue in the repository. If you are interested in contributing material directly to the repository, please see the [Contributors' Guide](Contributing.md).

SMD sometimes solicits a Request for Comment (RFC) to gather community input on specific topics for the development of open-source science guidance. The guideline on [registration of DOIs for data citation](request_for_comment/draft/RFC_001_data_citation_identifier.md) is one such example of guidance developed following an RFC. The process for developing additional guidelines is still being refined, but [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DaFJpTCfl3cuTqBn7c32Bs8RNxRsa3vJnurmgh9SlXA/edit?usp=sharing) provides an overview.

Please contact the maintainers or send an email to <HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov> with any questions. 

## Limitations

This repository does not establish policy requirements related to SMD funded activities. While this guidance is consistent with [SPD-41a: Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/spd-41), it may not be comprehensive or complete, and there may be other ways in which to comply with existing or future agreements or requirements not described here. 
For specific requirements related to scientific information produced from SMD-funded scientific activities, please see [SPD-41a](https://science.nasa.gov/spd-41), NASA policies, and/or any requirements in the solicitation or agreement associated with the activity.

This repository will be updated as new information becomes available.
